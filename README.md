# IntelGNA-2023-Kit
I pulled together the latest parts of Intel's depreciated GNA linux stuff.
I also removed a ton of stuff that just got in the way.  
If you check in the Resources file, you can find the original, unedited versions these files got pulled from.

This is supposed to be built with CMake but a bunch of that seemed broken/more complicated than just building it direct with GCC.

While I've seen exactly zero data to support this, apparently, GNA devices are basicially super "low power" matrix multipliers (low power compared to what?) - seems like that could be useful, in theory.... maybe.
